# ATM Project 
The ATM project is a Java-based application designed to simulate the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides users with a simple command-line interface to perform basic banking operations such as checking account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.

## Key Features
* Check Balance: Users can check their account balance to view the current amount of funds available.
* Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient funds available.
* Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account by specifying the amount to be deposited.
* Exit: Users can exit the application when they are done performing transactions.
## How It Works
1. Welcome Screen: Upon running the application, users are greeted with a welcome message and a menu of available options.
2. User Input: Users can choose from the available options by entering the corresponding numbers using the keyboard.
3. Balance Checking: If the user chooses to check their balance, the application displays the current account balance.
4. Withdrawal: If the user chooses to withdraw money, they are prompted to enter the amount they wish to withdraw. If the withdrawal amount is within the available balance, the transaction is processed, and the new balance is displayed.
5. Deposit: If the user chooses to deposit money, they are prompted to enter the amount they wish to deposit. The deposit amount is added to the account balance, and the new balance is displayed.
6. Exiting the Application: Users can exit the application at any time by choosing the exit option from the menu.
## Purpose
The purpose of the ATM project is to provide users with a simplified interface for performing basic banking operations. It serves as a learning tool for understanding fundamental concepts of programming, including user input, decision making, and data manipulation.

## Technologies Used
* Java Programming Language
* Command-Line Interface (CLI)
